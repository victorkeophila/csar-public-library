**Nifi** is a technical component provided by YSTIA allowing data acquisition, simple event processing, transport and delivery mechanism designed to accommodate the diverse dataflows generated by connected systems (Databases, Sensors, Data Lakes, Data Platforms).

**Nifi** is used for data ingestion to pull data into NiFi, from numerous different data sources and create FlowFiles using a process group.
A Process Group is a specific set of processes and their connections, which can receive data via input ports and send data out via output ports. In this manner, process groups allow creation of entirely new components simply by composition of other components.

See https://nifi.apache.org/ for details.

The following figure shows Nifi node configuration.
