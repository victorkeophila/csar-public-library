Recovery
********

This section describes how to recover manually BDCF components.
This will be useful, for example, after a reboot of VMs that host BDCF components.

The start/stop scripts of BDCF components are integrated as **services** into the Linux init system **systemd**.

Some BDCF components/services are automatically started at boot, while others are not.

Useful **systemd** basic commands:

- To start a service::

    $ sudo systemctl start <service-name>

- To stop a service::

    $ sudo systemctl stop <service-name>

- To get the status of a service, followed by most recent log data from the journal::

    $ sudo systemctl status <service-name>

- To show the messages for the service::

    $ journalctl -u <service-name>

  or::
  
    $ journalctl -u <service-name> --no-pager

Consul
======

The Consul component (agent and server) matches the **consul** systemd service.

The **consul** service is not started at boot.

The **consul** service corresponding to the server must be started first, then the **consul** services corresponding to the agents can be started.

ELK and Kafka
=============

Elasticsearch
-------------

The Elasticsearch component matches the **elasticsearch** systemd service.

The **elasticsearch** service is not started at boot.

If the Elasticsearch component depends on a Consul agent, the associated **consul** service must be started first.

Logstash
--------

The Logstash component matches the **logstash** systemd service.

The **logstash** service is not started at boot.

If the Logstash component depends on a Consul agent, the associated **consul** service must be started first.

Kibana
------

The Kibana component matches two systemd services:

- **kibana** service
- **elasticsearch** service corresponding to the Elasticsearch client associated to Kibana.

When the **kibana** service is started, the **elasticsearch** service is automatically started.

When the **kibana** service is stopped, the **elasticsearch** service is not automatically stopped.

So, to start Kibana component, just start the **kibana** service. To stop Kibana component, stop the **elasticsearch** service, then the **kibana** service .

The **kibana** service is not started at boot.

If the Kibana component depends on a Consul agent, the associated **consul** service must be started first.

Beats
-----

Each Beats component matches one systemd service :

- FileBeat: **filebeat** service
- PacketBeat: **packetbeat** service
- TopBeat: **topbeat** service

The beat services are not started at boot.

Kafka
-----

The Kafka component matches two systemd services:

- **zookeeper** service
- **kafka** service

To start Kafka component, start first the **zookeeper** service, then the **kafka** service.

To stop Kafka component, stop first the **kafka** service, then the **zookeeper** service.

The **zookeeper** and **kafka** services are not started at boot.

If the Kafka component depends on a Consul agent, the associated **consul** service must be started first.

For a Kafka cluster, **zookeeper** services must be started first on all the nodes of the cluster, then **kafka** services can be started.

ELK topologies
--------------

For **elk-basic** topology, the start order of the services is the following:

- Start consul server on Compute_CS
- Start consul agents on Compute_ES, Compute_KBN, and Compute_LS
- Start elasticsearch service on Compute_ES
- Start kibana service on Compute_KBN (elasticsearch client service is automatically started)
- Sart logstash service on Compute_LS.

For **elk-broker** topology, the start order of the services is the following:

- Start consul server on Compute_CS
- Start consul agents on Compute_ES, Compute_KBN, Compute_KFK, Compute_LI and Compute_LS
- Start elasticsearch service on Compute_ES
- Start kibana service on Compute_KBN (elasticsearch client service is automatically started)
- Start zookeeper service, then kafka service on Compute_KFK
- Start logstash service on Compute_LI
- Start logstash service on Compute_LS.

For **elk-ha** topology:

- Mount the **LinuxFileSystem** on the nodes of Elasticsearch cluster and Kafka cluster. For example::

      $ sudo mount /dev/vdb1 /mountedStorageES
      $ sudo mount /dev/vdb1 /mountedStorageKFK

- Start services in the same order as for **elk-broker** topology except for Kafka cluster.
  Indeed, **zookeeper** services must be started first on all the nodes of the cluster, then **kafka** services can be started.

Studios for data scientists
===========================

RStudio
-------

The RStudio component matches the **rstudio-server** systemd service.

The **rstudio-server** service is automatically started at boot.

Jupyter
-------

The Jupyter component matches the **jupyter** systemd service.

The **jupyter** service is not started at boot.
